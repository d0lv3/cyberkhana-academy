      markdownContent: `# Sets

A **set** is an unordered collection with **no duplicates**.

---

## Creating one

Curly braces, or \`set()\` from any iterable:

\`\`\`python
ports = {80, 443, 80, 22}
print(ports)        # {80, 443, 22}
print(len(ports))   # 3 , the duplicate 80 is gone
\`\`\`

You didn't remove the duplicate; a set simply can't hold one.

**An empty set needs \`set()\`.** \`{}\` is an empty **dictionary**, dicts claimed the braces first:

\`\`\`python
type({})      # dict
type(set())   # set
\`\`\`

---

## What you give up

**No order**, so **no indexing**:

\`\`\`python
ports[0]   # TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
\`\`\`

There's no "first" item in a set. If you need order, use a list, or \`sorted(my_set)\`, which returns a list.

**Items must be immutable** (technically, *hashable*):

\`\`\`python
{(1, 2), "text", 3}   # fine, tuple, str, int
{[1, 2]}              # TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
\`\`\`

This is the practical reason tuples exist. A set finds items by their hash, and a value that can change would break that.

---

## What you gain

**Deduplication in one step**, the most common use by far:

\`\`\`python
scan = [443, 22, 8080, 22, 443]
sorted(set(scan))   # [22, 443, 8080]
\`\`\`

\`set()\` drops duplicates, \`sorted()\` gives back an ordered list. You wrote this in the last challenge.

**Fast membership.** \`x in my_set\` is dramatically faster than \`x in my_list\` for large collections, the set jumps straight to the answer, while the list checks items one by one. With a million items that's the difference between instant and a noticeable wait.

If your code asks "have I seen this before?" a lot, visited URLs, scanned hosts, seen hashes, a set is the right structure.

---

## Try It

Run the starter code. Note \`type({})\` is \`dict\`, not \`set\`, the mistake everyone makes once.

      markdownContent: `# Set Methods: Changing

Sets are mutable, so, like lists, these methods change the set and return \`None\`.

---

## Adding

\`\`\`python
ports.add(22)                # one item
ports.update([8080, 3306])   # many
\`\`\`

\`add()\` on something already present does **nothing**, no error, no duplicate. That's the point: adding is idempotent, so you never need to check first.

\`update()\` is the set's \`extend\`: it loops over its argument. So \`update("ab")\` adds \`'a'\` and \`'b'\`, not \`"ab"\`.

## Removing

\`\`\`python
ports.discard(3306)   # remove if present, silent if not
ports.remove(8080)    # remove, KeyError if not present
ports.pop()           # remove an ARBITRARY item, and return it
ports.clear()         # empty it
\`\`\`

\`discard\` vs \`remove\` is the only real decision:

- **\`discard()\`**, "make sure it's gone." Missing is fine.
- **\`remove()\`**, "take this out." Missing is a bug, so it raises.

Choose the one that matches what a missing value would *mean*. Same reasoning as \`find()\` vs \`index()\` on strings.

\`pop()\` removes an **arbitrary** item, not the first, a set has no first. It's for "give me any one," and raises \`KeyError\` on an empty set.

---

## Try It

Run the starter code. \`add(80)\` when 80 is already there changes nothing, and \`discard(9999)\` on a missing value raises nothing. Swap in \`remove(9999)\` to see the \`KeyError\`.

      markdownContent: `# Set Methods: Comparing

This is where sets stop being "lists without duplicates" and start earning their place. You can compare two sets in one operation.

---

## The four operations

\`\`\`python
expected = {22, 80, 443}
found    = {22, 443, 8080}

found | expected   # {22, 80, 443, 8080}  union, in either
found & expected   # {22, 443}            intersection, in both
found - expected   # {8080}               difference, in found only
found ^ expected   # {80, 8080}           symmetric difference, in one, not both
\`\`\`

Each has a method form, which reads better in a long line:

\`\`\`python
found.union(expected)
found.intersection(expected)
found.difference(expected)
found.symmetric_difference(expected)
\`\`\`

The operators need both sides to be sets; the methods accept any iterable, so \`found.union([1, 2])\` works.

---

## Why this matters

Read that example again as a security question. You have the ports you **expected** open and the ports you **found** open:

\`\`\`python
found - expected     # {8080} , unexpected! investigate
expected - found     # {80}   , expected but missing
found & expected     # {22, 443} , as designed
\`\`\`

Three lines answer the whole question. The list version is a nested loop and a page of code. Any time you're comparing two collections, old vs new users, allowed vs actual, yesterday's hosts vs today's, reach for sets.

Note \`-\` is **not** symmetric: \`found - expected\` and \`expected - found\` answer different questions.

## Relationships

These return a \`bool\`:

\`\`\`python
{22, 80} <= expected           # True , subset: all of mine are in yours
expected >= {22, 80}           # True , superset
{1, 2}.isdisjoint({3, 4})      # True , nothing in common
\`\`\`

\`<=\` is \`issubset()\`, \`>=\` is \`issuperset()\`. Useful for "does this user have all required permissions?":

\`\`\`python
required <= user_perms
\`\`\`

      markdownContent: `# Dictionaries

A **dictionary** stores **key → value** pairs. Instead of "item number 3," you ask for \`"port"\`.

It's the most important data structure in Python. JSON, API responses, config files and object attributes are all dictionaries underneath.

---

## Creating one

\`\`\`python
host = {"ip": "10.0.0.5", "port": 8080, "up": True}
empty = {}
\`\`\`

Compare with the list version:

\`\`\`python
host = ["10.0.0.5", 8080, True]
host[1]        # 8080, but what IS 8080? you have to remember
host["port"]   # 8080, the code says what it means
\`\`\`

That's the whole argument for dicts.

## Reading

\`\`\`python
host["ip"]   # '10.0.0.5'
\`\`\`

A missing key **raises**:

\`\`\`python
host["missing"]   # KeyError: 'missing'
\`\`\`

\`.get()\` is the safe version, it returns \`None\` instead, or a default you choose:

\`\`\`python
host.get("missing")              # None
host.get("missing", "unknown")   # 'unknown'
\`\`\`

Use \`[]\` when the key **must** exist, the \`KeyError\` is a real bug you want to hear about. Use \`.get()\` when it's genuinely optional. Same judgement as \`remove\` vs \`discard\`.

To just check:

\`\`\`python
"ip" in host   # True, checks KEYS, not values
\`\`\`

## Writing

Adding and updating are the same line:

\`\`\`python
host["os"] = "linux"   # new key -> added
host["port"] = 443     # existing key -> replaced
\`\`\`

No error either way, so a typo silently creates a key rather than failing. Worth remembering when a value mysteriously "doesn't update."

---

## The rules on keys and values

**Keys must be immutable**, \`str\`, \`int\`, \`tuple\`. Not lists. Same hashing reason as sets, and the practical payoff:

\`\`\`python
{("10.0.0.5", 80): "http"}   # a tuple key, fine
\`\`\`

**Keys are unique.** Assigning an existing key replaces it.

**Values can be anything**, lists, other dicts, whatever. Nested dicts are how JSON maps into Python.

Since Python 3.7, dicts **keep insertion order**, so looping gives your keys back in the order you added them.

---

## Try It

Run the starter code. Then uncomment the \`host["missing"]\` line and read the \`KeyError\`, then compare with what \`.get()\` does.

print(host["proto"])
`,
      markdownContent: `# Dictionary Methods: Access

---

## keys, values, items

\`\`\`python
host.keys()     # dict_keys(['ip', 'port', 'up'])
host.values()   # dict_values(['10.0.0.5', 8080, True])
host.items()    # dict_items([('ip', '10.0.0.5'), ...])
\`\`\`

\`items()\` gives **(key, value) tuples**, which is why this is the standard way to loop a dict:

\`\`\`python
for key, value in host.items():
    print(f"{key} = {value}")
\`\`\`

Each item is a tuple, unpacked into \`key, value\`, exactly the tuple unpacking from Module 5. It's all the same idea reappearing.

## They're views, not lists

\`keys()\` doesn't return a list. It returns a **view**, a live window onto the dict:

\`\`\`python
keys = host.keys()
host["os"] = "linux"
print(list(keys))   # ['ip', 'port', 'up', 'os'] , it updated itself
\`\`\`

That's efficient (nothing is copied) and occasionally surprising. Two consequences:

- Wrap in \`list()\` if you want a snapshot, or need indexing: \`list(host.keys())[0]\`.
- **Never add or remove keys while looping** over a view, Python raises \`RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\`. Loop over \`list(host.keys())\` if you must modify.

Handily, views support set operations, because keys are unique:

\`\`\`python
host.keys() & {"ip", "mac"}   # {'ip'}, which of these exist?
\`\`\`

## setdefault

"Give me this key; if it's missing, create it with this value first":

\`\`\`python
host.setdefault("port", 22)      # 8080, exists, so unchanged
host.setdefault("proto", "tcp")  # 'tcp', missing, so added
\`\`\`

The difference from \`.get()\` matters: \`.get()\` never modifies the dict; \`setdefault()\` **writes the default in**.

---

## Try It

Run the starter code. Watch \`keys\` pick up \`"os"\` on its own, that's the view being live, not a stale copy.

      markdownContent: `# Dictionary Methods: Changing

---

## update(), merge

\`\`\`python
host.update({"port": 443, "os": "linux"})
\`\`\`

Existing keys are **overwritten**, new ones added. It's the bulk version of \`host[k] = v\`, and the usual way to apply overrides on top of defaults:

\`\`\`python
settings = DEFAULTS.copy()
settings.update(user_settings)   # user wins
\`\`\`

Since 3.9, \`|\` merges into a **new** dict, leaving both originals alone:

\`\`\`python
{"a": 1} | {"b": 2}   # {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
\`\`\`

Right-hand side wins on conflicts. Use \`|\` when you want a new dict, \`update()\` to modify in place.

## pop() and popitem()

\`\`\`python
port = host.pop("port")        # removes it, returns the VALUE
host.pop("gone", "n/a")        # a default avoids the KeyError
host.popitem()                 # removes and returns the LAST pair
\`\`\`

\`pop()\` without a default raises \`KeyError\` on a missing key, the default makes it safe, mirroring \`.get()\`.

\`popitem()\` returns a \`(key, value)\` tuple. Since 3.7 it takes the **last inserted** pair, which makes a dict usable as a stack. On an empty dict it raises \`KeyError\`.

\`del host["ip"]\` also removes, but returns nothing.

## clear() and copy()

\`\`\`python
host.clear()   # empty it
copy = host.copy()
\`\`\`

And the same warning as lists, **\`copy()\` is shallow**:

\`\`\`python
a = {"tags": ["web"]}
b = a.copy()
b["tags"].append("prod")
print(a)   # {'tags': ['web', 'prod']} , the inner list is shared
\`\`\`

The dict is new; the values inside are the same objects. For nested data use \`copy.deepcopy()\`.

---

## The pattern behind all of it

You've now seen it three times:

| | missing key/value | safe version |
|---|---|---|
| dict | \`d[k]\` → KeyError | \`d.get(k, default)\` |
| dict | \`d.pop(k)\` → KeyError | \`d.pop(k, default)\` |
| set | \`remove()\` → KeyError | \`discard()\` |
| list | \`index()\` → ValueError | \`in\` first |

Python consistently offers a loud version and a quiet one. Pick by asking: *would missing mean a bug?* If yes, take the loud one.

---

## Try It

Run the starter code. The last block is the shallow-copy trap again, same lesson as lists, now with dicts.

## Instructions

Given:

\`\`\`python
baseline = {"10.0.0.5": [22, 80], "10.0.0.6": [443]}
current  = {"10.0.0.5": [22, 80, 8080], "10.0.0.7": [22]}
\`\`\`

print **exactly**:

\`\`\`
New hosts: ['10.0.0.7']
Gone hosts: ['10.0.0.6']
10.0.0.5 opened: [8080]
\`\`\`

## Rules

- Hard-code nothing, derive it all from the two dicts.
- **New hosts**: in \`current\`, not in \`baseline\`. **Gone hosts**: the reverse.
- The last line covers hosts in **both**: ports open now that weren't before.
- Every list printed must be **sorted**.

## What you need

The key insight: **\`dict.keys()\` supports set operations**, because keys are unique.

\`\`\`python
current.keys() - baseline.keys()   # new hosts
baseline.keys() & current.keys()   # hosts in both
\`\`\`

Then for a shared host, compare its port lists as sets, \`set(a) - set(b)\` gives what's new.

You'll need a small loop for the last line. If \`for host in ...\` is still unfamiliar, it's fine to peek ahead, the Loops module covers it properly.
